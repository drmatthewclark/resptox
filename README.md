dyspnoea-stratified -  EBGM results for drug-dyspnoea, stratified by route of administration
dyspnoea-nonstratified -  EBGM results for drug-dyspnoea, without stratification
route-dyspnoea -  EBGM results correlating route of administration with dyspneoa

note: could also stratify by indication as many adverse events are related to the disease being treated.  FAERS captures this, but it is not a very controlled vocabulary 

as one can see from the route-dyspnoea table several routes could be collapsed more as well
