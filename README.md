the FDA FAERS data (https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html) is computed from the most recent release of July-September 2024 the "2024q3" release.
the earliest FAERS file is 1969


dyspnoea-stratified -  EBGM results for drug-dyspnoea, stratified by route of administration
dyspnoea-nonstratified -  EBGM results for drug-dyspnoea, without stratification
route-dyspnoea -  EBGM results correlating route of administration with dyspneoa

note: could also stratify by indication as many adverse events are related to the disease being treated.  FAERS captures this, but it is not a very controlled vocabulary 

as one can see from the route-dyspnoea table several routes could be collapsed more as well
